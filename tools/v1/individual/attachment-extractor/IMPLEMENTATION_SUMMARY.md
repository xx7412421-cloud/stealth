**Total**: ~2,200 lines of production-ready code

### Core Features

**1. File Extraction & Categorization**

- 6 file categories: image, document, archive, video, audio, other
- 26 supported MIME types out of the box
- Automatic category detection
- Custom category mapping support

**2. Validation**

- File size limits (50MB default, configurable)
- MIME type whitelist enforcement
- Detailed error messages
- 4 error classification types

**3. State Management**

- React hook: `useExtractor()`
- 4 loading states: idle, loading, success, error
- File selection/deselection
- Statistics tracking by category
- Attachment removal & bulk clear

**4. Metadata Extraction**

- Image dimensions (width × height)
- Video/audio duration
- Document page count
- File timestamps
- Optional checksum generation

**5. UI Component**

- Drag-and-drop upload
- File list with inline editing
- Real-time statistics
- Selection toolbar
- Error display
- Empty states
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)

### API Surface

**Hook**

```typescript
const {
  state,                    // Current state
  extract,                  // Extract files async
  selectAttachment,         // Toggle selection
  selectAll/deselectAll,    // Batch selection
  removeAttachment,         // Remove file
  downloadAttachment,       // Download single
  downloadSelected,         // Download selected
  clearAll,                 // Clear all
  reset,                    // Reset state
} = useExtractor(options?);
```

**Service Functions**

- `extractAttachments(files, options)` - Main extraction
- `validateFile(file, options)` - File validation
- `categorizeMimeType(mimeType)` - Category detection
- `formatFileSize(bytes)` - Human-readable sizes
- `calculateStats(attachments, errors)` - Stats calculation

**Component**

```typescript
<AttachmentExtractorUI
  options={extractionOptions}
  onFilesExtracted={(count) => {}}
/>
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **No App Integration Yet** - Tool is completely isolated. Integration (showing in compose, saving to DB) will be a separate issue.

2. **Mock Fixtures** - All test data is deterministic, no network calls needed.

3. **Folder-Local Styles** - CSS is isolated to prevent conflicts with main design system.

4. **Pure Services** - All business logic is pure functions, no side effects.

5. **React Hooks** - State management uses React hooks, no external state library.

6. **TypeScript Throughout** - Full type safety, no `any` types.

   - Feature overview
   - Type definitions
   - API usage examples
   - Testing guide
   - Future integration notes

2. **Inline Comments**
   - All functions documented
   - Complex logic explained
   - TypeScript types annotated

3. **Demo Component**

## Next Steps for Integration

When linking to main app (separate issue):

1. **Compose Integration**
   - Add AttachmentExtractorUI to compose modal
   - Display extracted attachments in message

2. **Storage Integration**
   - Save attachments to message storage
   - Manage attachment lifecycle

3. **Inbox Integration**
   - Display attachments in inbox
   - Attachment management UI

4. **Design System Integration**
   - Use main app design tokens if needed
   - Update styles for consistency

**Note**: All integration work goes in separate issue. This tool is ready to use as-is.

## Acceptance

This implementation is **ready for production review**:

- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Self-contained and isolated
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ No main app modifications
- ✅ Production build succeeds
- ✅ Can be integrated later without breaking changes

Future integration will be straightforward since:

- Clean API surface
- No hidden dependencies
- Well-tested core logic
- Demo shows all features
